**BasicWebApp** is a project which starts with a simple Python WebApp which uses the Streamlit and YFinance libraries to display stock data on Google's stock. This app is then packaged up into a Docker image, deployed to an AWS EC2 Autoscaling group backed by an Elastic Load Balancer. The whole stack is finished off by a CI/CD pipeline which used Jenkins to automatically build and deploy a new Docker image if a new commit is pushed to the master branch.
